# Dotfiles

Some simple dotfiles so I can move configuration
to new machines easily. Tuned for a very basic Arch Linux
install.

Clone and run

```
./setup-configs.sh
```

on a fresh machine to setup.

## Package Installation

Also includes a package listing for pacman, install these packages with

```
./install-pkglist.sh
```

## AUR packages
